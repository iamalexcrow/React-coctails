      hanks for the thorough and fair review! Garmin missed an opportunity with trail and ultra runners. I would've preferred to see maps, wifi and music included, but able to turn on and off (so download latest map, then go offline for a run) to preserve battery life. Or use live maps with ClimbPro if battery life is not an issue. And as an ultra runner, don't need 80 hours b/c can do 100 miler with my 945 and for multi-day event (200+ miles) can recharge overnight. Maybe this is something Garmin can address in an update.
